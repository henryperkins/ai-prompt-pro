# Archive Notes (2026-02)

Archived on: 2026-02-26

These files were moved out of the active `docs/` root because they are completed historical plans/checklists.

- `design-system-phase2-implementation-plan.md`
  - Reason: superseded by later completion and canonical policy in `docs/design-system.md`.
- `design-system-phase3-implementation-plan.md`
  - Reason: explicitly marked completed; retained for historical implementation detail only.
- `neon-migration-checklist.md`
  - Reason: migration phases are complete; active operations are captured in `docs/neon-cutover-runbook.md`.
- `hookup-audit-plan.md`
  - Reason: one-time audit/action artifact with completed findings.

If a file here needs to become active again, move it back to `docs/` root and update `docs/README.md`.

## Root planning artifacts moved here

To reduce repository-root clutter, historical top-level planning files were moved to `docs/archive/2026-02/root-planning/`:

- `brainstorm.md`
- `implementation-surface-investigation.md`
- `launch-sprint-prioritized-checklist.md`
- `market-exploration-report.md`
- `plan.md`

## Additional historical plans and reviews

Moved from `docs/` root as superseded point-in-time artifacts:

- `plans/completespec.md`
  - Reason: architecture-era spec with Supabase-era assumptions and phased contracts no longer matching current runtime policy.
- `plans/builder-form-redesign-implementation-plan.md`
  - Reason: phased redesign proposal with outdated backend assumptions (for example Supabase Edge Function guidance).
- `reviews/design-system-audit.md`
  - Reason: dated audit snapshot (`2026-02-23`) with findings partially superseded by subsequent implementation.
- `reviews/design-system-critique.md`
  - Reason: one-time critique artifact tied to earlier migration state; retained for historical context.
- `reviews/design-system-review.md`
  - Reason: point-in-time design-system review snapshot moved from repo root to keep active documentation surface focused.

## Generated snapshot artifacts

- `snapshots/repomix-output.md`
  - Reason: generated repository snapshot that becomes stale quickly; archived to avoid treating it as active source documentation.
