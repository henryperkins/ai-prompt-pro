## Installation

The `untitledui` CLI tool is available directly as a command-line utility and doesn't require any installation. You can run it using either npx or bunx:

<CodeTabs>
  <CodeTabList items={[
    { id: "npx", label: "npx" },
    { id: "bunx", label: "bunx" }
  ]}/>
  <CodeTabPanel id="npx">
    ```bash
    npx untitledui@latest [command]
    ```
  </CodeTabPanel>
  <CodeTabPanel id="bunx">
    ```bash
    bunx untitledui@latest [command]
    ```
  </CodeTabPanel>
</CodeTabs>

        <Steps>
            <Step title="Create a new project">
                Run this command in your root folder to create a new Next.js project:

                ```bash
                npx untitledui@latest init --nextjs
                ```

                While running the command, you'll be asked a few questions to set up your project:

                ```bash
                ? What is your project named? › untitled-ui
                ? Which color would you like to use as the brand color? ›
                ❯   brand
                    error
                    warning
                    success
                  ↓ gray-neutral
                ```

                This will create a new Next.js project in the `untitled-ui` directory with all the necessary configurations and components pre-installed.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Ready to go!">
                Great! You're all set to start using Untitled UI components.

                If something is missing, you can copy/paste what you need into your project directly from individual [components](/components) pages.

<Divider />

## Add command

The `add` command allows you to add specific Untitled UI components to your existing project.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add components">
    To add a specific component:
    
    ```bash
    npx untitledui@latest add button
    ```
    
    You can add multiple components at once:
    
    ```bash
    npx untitledui@latest add button toggle avatar
    ```
    
    If you run the command without specifying any components, you'll first be asked to select a component type:
    
    ```bash
    npx untitledui@latest add
    ```
    
    This will display a type selection interface:
    
    ```bash
    ? What type of component are you adding? ›
    ❯ base
      marketing
      shared-assets
      application
      foundations
    ```
    
    After selecting a type, you'll see available components in that category:
    
    ```bash
    ? Which components would you like to add? ›
    ❯ ◯ button
      ◯ card
      ◯ dropdown
      ◯ input
      ◯ modal
      ◯ table
      ◯ tabs
      ◯ toast
      ◯ toggle
      ◯ tooltip
    ```
    
    You can navigate through the list using arrow keys, select components with the spacebar, and confirm your selection with Enter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="PRO components">
    For PRO components, you need to be authenticated:
    
    ```bash
    npx untitledui@latest login
    npx untitledui@latest add pro-component
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customization options">
    The add command offers several options:

    ```bash
    # Specify where to add components
    npx untitledui@latest add button --path src/components

    # Specify project directory
    npx untitledui@latest add button --dir ./my-project

    # Overwrite existing files
    npx untitledui@latest add button --overwrite

    # Non-interactive mode (for AI agents/CI)
    npx untitledui@latest add button --yes
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Command options

These are the available options for the `add` command:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-a, --all` | Add all available components |
| `-o, --overwrite` | Overwrite existing files |
| `-p, --path <path>` | The path to add the component to |
| `-d, --dir <directory>` | The directory where the project is located |
| `-t, --type <type>` | The type of the component to add (`base`, `marketing`, `shared-assets`, `application`, `foundations`) |
| `--include-all-components` | Automatically include all base components without prompting |
| `-y, --yes` | Non-interactive mode - use defaults for all prompts (for AI agents/CI) |

## Login command

The `login` command allows you to authenticate with Untitled UI to access PRO components through the CLI.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Interactive authentication">
    To authenticate with your Untitled UI account:
    
    ```bash
    npx untitledui@latest login
    ```
    
    This will:
    1. Open your browser automatically
    2. Check if you're already signed in to Untitled UI
    3. **If already signed in**: Authenticate immediately and return to CLI
    4. **If not signed in**: Redirect to the sign-in page, send a magic link to your email, and authenticate after you click the link
  </Step>
  <Step title="What happens after login">
    Once authenticated, you can access PRO components without authenticating again.
    
    Your authentication is saved locally and will persist across CLI sessions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding example pages

The `example` command allows you to add complete example pages to your project or initialize new projects based on example pages. These example pages include fully functional pages with all necessary components, styling, and functionality.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Interactive example selection">
    To browse and add an example interactively:
    
    ```bash
    npx untitledui@latest example
    ```
    
    This will prompt you to select from available example categories:
    
    ```bash
    ? Select which type of example you want to add ›
    ❯ Application
      Marketing
    ```
    
    After selecting a category, you'll see specific examples available in that category, and then be prompted for where to place the files:
    
    ```bash
    ? Where would you like to add the dashboard-01 example? › app
    ? Where would you like to add the components? › components
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add specific examples">
    You can directly specify an example to add:
    
    ```bash
    # Add a specific dashboard example
    npx untitledui@latest example dashboards-01
    ```
    
    For nested examples, you can specify the full path:
    
    ```bash
    npx untitledui@latest example dashboards-01/01
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="PRO examples">
    Many examples require PRO access. If you try to access a PRO example without authentication, you'll see:
    
    ```bash
    🔒 The dashboard-01 example requires PRO access.

    To access PRO examples:
      → If you've already purchased: npx untitledui@latest login
      → To purchase PRO examples: https://www.untitledui.com/buy/react
    ```
    
    Simply authenticate first, then add the example:
    
    ```bash
    npx untitledui@latest login
    npx untitledui@latest example dashboard-01
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customization options">
    The example command offers several options for customization:

    ```bash
    # Specify where to add the example page
    npx untitledui@latest example dashboard-01/05 --example-path src/app/dashboard

    # Specify where to add the components
    npx untitledui@latest example dashboard-01/05 --path components/ui

    # Overwrite existing files
    npx untitledui@latest example dashboard-01/05 --overwrite

    # Non-interactive mode (for AI agents/CI)
    npx untitledui@latest example dashboard-01/05 --yes
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="What gets added">
    When you add an example, the CLI will:
    
    1. **Add the main example page** to your specified directory (default: `app/` or `pages/`)
    2. **Install required components** that the example uses
    3. **Install dependencies** needed for the example
    4. **Configure imports** to match your project structure
    5. **Prompt for component selection** if multiple components are needed
    
    The example will be fully functional and ready to use in your project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Command options

These are the available options for the `example` command:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-o, --overwrite` | Overwrite existing files. |
| `-p, --path <path>` | The path to add the components to. |
| `-e, --example-path <path>` | The path to add the example file to. |
| `--include-all-components` | Automatically include all components from the example without prompting. |
| `-y, --yes` | Non-interactive mode - use defaults for all prompts (for AI agents/CI). |

<FAQ
  faqs={[
    {
      question: "How do I access PRO components?",
      answer: "You can access PRO components by authenticating with the `npx untitledui@latest login` command. This will open your browser for a one-time authentication process."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to login every time I use the CLI?",
      answer: "No, you only need to login once per machine. Your authentication credentials are saved locally and will persist across CLI sessions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the CLI with an existing project?",
      answer: "Yes, you can use the `add` command to add Untitled UI components to your existing project. The CLI will automatically detect your project structure and configure imports accordingly."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between components and examples?",
      answer: "Components are individual UI elements (like `button`, `avatars`, `tables`), while examples are complete, functional pages that showcase how multiple components work together in real-world scenarios."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize examples after adding them?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Once an example is added to your project, you own the code completely. You can modify, extend, or customize it however you need for your specific use case."
    },
    {
      question: "Do examples include their dependencies?",
      answer: "Yes, when you add an example, the CLI automatically installs all required dependencies and components. The example will be fully functional immediately after installation."
    },
    {
      question: "What frameworks are supported?",
      answer: "Currently, the CLI supports Next.js and Vite projects. You can specify the framework during initialization or the CLI will auto-detect your project type."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the CLI modify my existing code?",
      answer: "The `add` command only adds new files to your project. It won't modify your existing code unless you use the `--overwrite` flag to replace existing files."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the installation directory?",
      answer: "Yes, you can use the `--path` flag to specify where components should be installed. For example: `npx untitledui@latest add button --path src/components/ui`."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the browser doesn't open during login?",
      answer: "If the browser doesn't open automatically during the login process, the CLI will display a URL that you can manually copy and paste into your browser."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I update components to the latest version?",
      answer: "You can re-run the `add` command with the `--overwrite` flag to update components to their latest versions: `npx untitledui@latest add button --overwrite`."
    }
